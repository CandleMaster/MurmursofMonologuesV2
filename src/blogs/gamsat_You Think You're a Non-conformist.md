There is an ironic contradiction between rebellion and the universality of its appeal. No matter how hard you go against the grain, your indignant defiance does not escape the contemporary discourse. Afterall, your commentaries, criticisms, ridicules and non-conformality are by definition responses to socio-political events, and as a way of life, can only mean to contemporary ones. "It's weird not to be weird," as John Lennon succinctly puts it. Indeed, conformity and non-conformity are both products of the modern narrative, two sides of the same coin.

Norms and cultures are often considered prevalent ideologies of the time, which like human nature, morphs and adapts. While this analogy is famously made by father of the social contract political theory Thomas Hobbs, it also echoes a similar sentiment of Socrates' that norms are arbitrary products of the contemporary. This means while dissents and snowballed social changes occur in every society, they are crystallizations of a shared history and social context. For instance, the increase in global advocacy events we currently see can perhaps be explained by the modern phenomenon of extreme internet accessibility leading to more communication and political literacy. A secondary explanation could be global poverty has substantially improved compared to the even near 20 years, leading to more time away from work and for reflection. Regardless, our norm of advocacy is new and unique to our society, though is also one that evolved out of our circumstances.  

Furthermore, if non-conformity is the alternative to conformity, rebelling is still conforming to the second largest group. In fact, this can be explained by ingroup psychology where one identifies to be a member of a social group and is associated with many behavioural phenomenon such as ingroup favouritism and outgroup bias. In other words, instead of conceptualizing people as rebellious, it's more psychologically consistent to describe them as supporting and seeking comfort in belonging to another group. It's not scary to go on "birth strike" for environmental reasons when there's a vast population of environment protectionists. It is also not radical to be off Facebook, when many have voiced criticisms of social media use. What some perceive as rebellious are perhaps mere ingroup behaviour. Afterall, both a norm and a reaction to a norm are different arguments from the same discourse.

While norms or culture does change, and is changed by people, its definition as a social consensus entails it to be changed only through people in the plural form. No, this does not suggest a paradox, but rather that gradually the minority rebel group will become the normal group dictating the norm. Concurrently a new group of rebels will form and the cycle continues. Therefore, despite the ironic universality of being a non-conformist, there are consequential merits in being one.
