Human rights are artificial constructs produced by governing entities. That's why we can fight for more rights. That's why different countries' constitutions have varying number of rights. However, as Nelson Mandela once poignantly commented, "When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, he has no choice but to become an outlaw." In exchanging our natural freedom for the benefits of living under a social contract, some are left with no increase in welfare, if not worse off, for their participation in this human tradition. 

The social construct demands a high level of trust in the governing body, with some systems abolishing the right to bare firearms, or demanding professions to be practiced only in the formal framework, such as justice through the legal system, medicine through the healthcare system, education through the K12 and university system, etc. In our compliance, it promises to protect us in various ways. However, the first issue arises when representation of you does not even exist in the legal system, such as Dalits in India. Despite constituting one sixth of the population, they are considered "untouchable" and inferior enough to not belong to the caste system, which India's legal system is practiced on. Considering how their mere existence isn't acknowledged by the system, it is almost absurd to demand their participation. 

The second issue is systemic injustice. They can take different forms, including discriminatory laws, prejudiced execution of law, social opinions and optics that affect policy making, etc. A sombre reminder is that anti-slavery laws weren't a global phenomenon until the 1860s, and the segregation practices endorsed by the Jim Crow Law wasn't abolished until a hundred years later. This evolution of legal changes illustrate that laws are living adaptations to our modern ideologies that gradually become more egalitarian through advocacy. Though that is also saying injustice is bountiful and occasionally a detriment to one's livelihood. A prejudiced judge, given the same case, may incarcerate one differently based on his or her race, gender, sexuality. A prejudiced system may provide social welfare for groups differently despite having the same financial standings. When one receives systemic and social injustice day in and day out, why then are they expected to comply?

The social contract does anticipate the variability of benefits one receives in the system, which perhaps a insignificant issue if one does reaps the benefits. Though one huge assumption of this contract is that the legal system is comprehensive and the social environment can self-regulate swiftly enough to integrate different groups into a cohesive community. Though history has shown the fight for freedom for ethnic minorities and for the LGBTQI that have not merely been left behind, but harmed by the system. Then what? All what the system can do is promise.
