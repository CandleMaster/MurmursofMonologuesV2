Organisms and societies self-organize under a few principles. There's Darwinian evolution or survival of the fittest. There's the law of entropy where the universe is unfolding spontaneously towards randomness. Though an underrated theme of how civilizations expand and humans congregate is the pursuit of beauty.  

The appreciation of beauty is an innate feature in many organisms, as much as beauty a marker for fitness contributing to their reproductive success. In BBC documentaries, we see the males of many bird and insect species to have more vibrant colours and prominent size. During mating season, through dance routines, rhythmic cuckooing, or flamboyant posing, the males showcase their beauty in the loudest way possible to attract females, with the most attention grabbing ones happily achieve success. As comical as these rituals seem on TV, humans cognition also shows positive bias towards beauty. Psychological studies have shown, people tend to attribute more positive traits, such as kindness and competence to  strangers with more symmetrical faces, a criteria for beauty. Though subconscious, our attraction to beautiful things and people are innate and influence us in invisible ways. 

Our demand for more and more aesthetic things is also demonstrated through technology and capitalism. During the infancy of internet, most websites were coded with just HTML, or showing just the content with minimal formatting and decoration. By today's standard, they seem primitive at best, ugly for most. Gradually, CSS, a formatting scripting language was adopted, such that there was versatile backgrounds, buttons, formats, alignment, and websites were looking as pretty as magazines, album covers, posters, etc. Fast-forward today, there's not only Javascript, a programming language which allows animation, but a plethora of libraries including ones for 3D rendering, providing infinite tools to make websites more beautiful. The fascinating thing was there were no central command or figure to guide the evolution of web design, rather the taste of individuals and entities convergently pushed to the aesthetics we have today.  

The ideal beauty is truth and goodness, according to Plato's allegory of the cave. Perhaps that's why art and the aesthetics has the ability to show us personal truth and wisdom. Nevertheless, just as pursuing truth and goodness comes naturally to us, we cannot help but appreciate what's beautiful.
