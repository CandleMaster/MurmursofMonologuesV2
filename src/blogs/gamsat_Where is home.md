Third culture kid, or TCK, is the unofficial title for my kind of people. It refers to one who was born an ethnic minority in a country, but grew up in another country, hence the third culture. My case was certainly TCK with a twist. Born a Chinese Australian, I lived in Sydney for 7 years until I was uprooted back to my ethnic homeland to the city of Shanghai. Ten years later, I attended undergraduate studies in US and returned to Australia after 5 years. Amidst the excitement of travelling and understanding unique cultures, I've constantly had to grapple with two questions: who I am and where is my home?  

My toughest transition was my first one, moving to China. Already used to speaking Mandarin and the Shanghainese dialect as secret languages with my parents in Sydney, I was shocked to hear them spoken everywhere as we arrived at Shanghai airport - of course, it was China. However, at the young age of 7, I couldn't comprehend how differently I behaved compared to local kids, why my accent (Australian) was mocked or why I didn’t enjoy conformity. What's more inexplicable was why I looked Chinese and spoke Chinese, but never felt Chinese. Therefore, 10 years had past without me feeling a sense of belonging, and I carried myself with the same air. 

The opportunity to attend college in the States was exciting to me, as it meant returning to a Western liberal environment. That's where I would belong, I thought. While I had more meaningful friendships, and found myself to identify with more Western ideologies, I still didn’t feel a full sense of belonging. With my relatively Chinese upbringing, I was self-conscious of how I am not outspoken enough or opinionated enough for the American culture. Thoroughly admiring those traits, I did invest much personal efforts in improving those fronts. However, after reflection of my personal values and reconciliating of both cultures, I aspired to be eloquent and outspoken to appease my western identity, whilst not loud or attention-seeking to appease my eastern one. One value after another, I tried to find an integration or common ground as synthesis for my personal identity.  

Five years had gone by before my decision to return Australia that was partially based on observing the down-to-earth nature in almost every Australians I've had met. If most Australians share this trait, what a wonderful environment it would be to live in. Therefore, having some peace in my identity, I've arrived in Melbourne. Funny enough, I was instantly comfortable for two reasons. First, I was comfortable with myself, knowing well who I am where ever I may be. Second, friends came more easily because of my new mindset, as well as what I expected of the genuineness of Australians. In finding my identity, I have found self-approval and self-love. I know with self-assurance, I carry my home everywhere I go. Coming full circle to my motherland, I have finally found my answers.
