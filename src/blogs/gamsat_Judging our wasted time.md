Life is finding busywork to occupy me until I die. Confronted with its brevity, I am forced to judge what is worthy or a waste of my time. Ironically, in stressing about this question, I feel the heavy weight of analysis paralysis which might be the most detrimental possibility of all. Our judgement is perhaps our biggest nemesis to having the most worthwhile time.

Work and productivity have been the most defining component of one's life throughout history. The Roman era stoicist, Seneca, advocated in "On the Shortness of Life" that one's life should be effectively dedicated to serving the public. Then, passed down by medieval times, thousands of last names originated from their ancestor's professions. Fast forward to today, it is common in many cultures to introduce ourselves by our profession. Standing the testament of time, our productive service to the world makes sense to be an essential identity to ourselves. What other tangible legacy is left beside our work when our ephemeral existence on earth ceases?

Our work can also be a source of accomplishment and joy, a record of growth, a signal of social status, thought perhaps should not be put on a pedestal. We hear tales of dying old men and women, wishing they have worked less and spent more time with their loved ones. Extracting their wisdom, time spent on cultivating meaningful relationships can go a long way. Furthermore, based on my own experiences, several serendipities with strangers have also created lasting memories for reflection and reminiscence. By extension, perhaps connections formed anywhere on the spectrum of with good friends to strangers can create an impact in our lives. 

Since moments of high is always balanced with moments of lows, finding activities that soothe or entertain us and make our struggles bearable also seem essential in maintaining our long-term well being. They can be in the form of hobbies, interests, exercise and entertainment, so long as they provide emotional regulation and enjoyment to continue our drives to explore life. In that sense, even doing nothing, which many may consider a waste of time, may be worthwhile if we see its purpose.

As I write to my conclusion, I find by giving worthiness to almost every possible human activity, the word worthiness has lost its meaning. Yet, it also seems to be the point, to explore the values of our endeavours just to find that we are too judgemental of them, when time itself has no eyes and will never criticize. To live with time well spent, is perhaps, just to live.
