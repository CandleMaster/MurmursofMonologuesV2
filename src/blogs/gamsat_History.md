Amongst the tens of billions of humans ever existed, only a miniscule percentage makes in down on history. They are the heroes, the villains, the inventors, the martyrs, the rulers, the pioneers. Beside the villains, whose names inked onto history books are those that changed the world for good. Indeed, if those brave enough to defy oppression and push against status quo donâ€™t deserve celebration, who does? 

Lauded as the best citizen Britain has ever had, Winston Churchill no only changed the course of history in his homeland, but also the world.  Even prior to WW2, Churchill, recognizing the xenophobic sentiment in Hitler's speeches, gave public warnings on the growing Nazi leadership in Germany, though without much success. Between 1938-1939, when the Nazi dominance has loomed over Austria, Czech Republic and eventually Poland, the last straw before UK and France declared war on Germany, many believed Germany too powerful an adversary. As this public opinion consolidated with France surrender in 8 days after Italy's attack, Churchill never hesitated in his resistance to Nazi. Forfeiting a fight would mean evil and injustice to humans will prevails, of which was against Churchill's ideologies. Thus despite its weaker military standing, Britain stood for the fight with much hardship though finally achieved victories with the rest of the Allies. 

On the other side of the world, a man celebrated for lifting his country, China, out of extreme poverty is Deng Xiaoping. Prior to his leadership, the country saw a radical transition from the last Imperialist Dynasty to a communism, from feudalism to collectivism. The reform, though founded on noble intention, was dragged down by corruption and inefficiency. Local officials overstated their food production capacity to appease their leader, Chairman Mao, while farmers struggled to keep up, having little monetary incentive or resource due to the collectivist economic model. Thus after the Mao's death, de facto leader Deng Xiaoping famously declared, "White cat, black cat, as long as it catches the mouse, it's a good cat." Defending his policies on agricultural privatization and other economic reforms against traditional communism, Deng explains that if the goal is for its people to achieve greater standard of living, his methods justify the means. Indeed, food production grew four years after his reforms, rural regions welcomed manufacturing, and eventually commenced an export industry, paving way to the export giant China is today. If not for Deng's insight and his guts to go against the established communist values, China might still be in extreme poverty as during Mao's rule. 

Men make history and not the other way around. It would also be futile to conjecture a history without these leaders. We owe our whole political historical view to our social context shaped by history and by them. Although these heroes will never know they are celebrated in the future, their stories are triumphant moments of humans as species and civilizations that will continue to inspire our actions.
