A shared mystery of the human condition is the often inexplicable nature of ourselves. Why do we yearn? What drives us? Why can this invisible force sprinkle magical fairy dust of success on what we do? Meanwhile, the modern narrative has also moved on from putting passion on a pedestal. As Jack Kerouac eloquently put, "My fault, my failure, is not in the passions I have, but in my lack of control of them." In mocking the positively driven meathead, one begs the reflection what is the relationship between passion and reason.

The story of the reckless passionate man is old, as old as the plotline of Homer's Iliad. The Trojan war broke out because Paris, brother of the Trojan king has stolen Helen, the most beautiful woman in the ancient world, but also wife of  King of Sparta. Surprisingly, this abduction is merely the start of a chain of reckless behaviours, by the Gods that partitioned to either sides of the war, by their manipulations of each other, by the shear violence of their supreme abilities, by the intelligent Achilles whose stubbornness led to the death of his best friend. The story ended in blood bath, with a winner in war, but no winners in life. No better fable can better illustrate the potential tragedy of passion without reason.

On the flip side, there is work without passion. The perpetrators are perhaps those chasing the rat race of a 9-5 job, pursuing money for the sake of life, which is in turn spent on making more money. While there is nobility in providing a future for one's family, somewhere along the chase, this mantra seems to be a lazy excuse to blame their responsibilities for their unhappiness, as opposed to taking their own responsibilities for their happiness. Perhaps with a bit more introspection, working for one's family would no long be a sacrificial act, but rather one full of ambition and thrill. Afterall, which kids want their lives to be founded on the misery of their parents'. 

The last scenario are the success stories lauded throughout generation. It is Shakespeare churning through volumes of lacklustre and unacclaimed work before Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet, it is Steve Jobs spending hundreds of hours in his garage in Silicon Valley before Macintosh, it is Van Gogh continuously painting famelessly before the recognition of his work after his death. Their success whether achieved during or after their lifetime is a marriage between passion and hard work. Their passion is also focused and sharpened to a tunnel, as they progressively refine their skills to reach their goals. From afar it is hard to tell if they've wavered, and it is perhaps that precisely that doesnâ€™t matter when persistence and resilience is programmed into their drive. 

It is always much easier to judge the lives of others than our owns. Through our own moralizing, it may be crystal clear that success demands both passion and reason. Therefore, a question harder than which of passion and reason is more valuable, is perhaps identifying which has accidently tipped the scale in our own lives. Am I charging aimlessly like the ancient Athenian gods or running heartlessly in a rat wheel?
