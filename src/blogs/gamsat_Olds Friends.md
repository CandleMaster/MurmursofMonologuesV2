It's non uncommon of our age, to wake up after an inebriated adventure, looking sort of unhinged, in day-old clothes, as flashbacks of all the foolish things done 10 hours prior come crashing down onto our memory logs, making us question, "how do I have friends?"

Indeed, the older I've become, the more I appreciate the friendships that I've kept from less mature days. The mistakes I can only see from the distance of time, must be visible to my friends then. Yet, they were able to overlook my weaknesses and love me regardless. 

I remember all my unhealthy habits, or rather a shared unhealthy habit amongst me and my friends, during college. Weeks before final exams, we would start camping in libraries with a slab of energy drinks, party bags of crisps, and tens and hours of semi-productive studying. Studying up til 1am, we would start talking about life and other nonsense, and studying a bit more to comfort ourselves, before ending up at a 24 hour diner with an order of bottomless pancakes. We were studious yet stupid. Though since my friends were in on it, we struggled through stress and sleep deprivation together and eventually outgrew this phase together. 

I remember my mistake of always overpacking my schedule. Juggling between coursework, research, leadership and volunteer positions, I had barely any time to fully grasp control on each of my task, let alone to spend on myself or my friends. While this phenomenon is fairly common amongst my friends, I appreciate them for reaching out the many times I couldn't. I appreciated them not only then, when I could use the love during times of stress, but also today, understanding its power as I reach out to others. 

Elbert Hubbard once said, "A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you." Indeed, as I wince to the flashbacks of my cringe-worthy actions and words, I am also filled with gratitude to the friends that stood by me and believed in me. They loved me when I wasn't even sure how to love myself. Perhaps, I was the same to them. In seeing the good and the potential in each other, we grew to be better people and our friendship also grew stronger.
