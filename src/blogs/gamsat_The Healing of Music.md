There's something wonderful about a melody. Three chords and a beat can bring lightness to one's feat,   water to one's eyes, or about imageries and memories. The shared experience of music also bestows it some grandeur -- the music isn't for just you and your companion but all its past and future listeners around the world. Thus, music puts you in context amongst an ocean of humanity. In melodies, we can live in the moment of healing and what's beyond our understanding.
 
The nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki left the world a sense of nihilism and destitute towards humanity. What arose from the ashes of the belief of virtue and human decency was first, Existentialism, which posits "you are free, therefore choose," conveying the urgency to wisely make every decision. Second, what also philosophically complemented existentialism was Jazz. The improvisational nature of the music demands one to be in every moment, because the unique note uniquely placed in this melody, once passed, will be gone forever. Appreciate now, live in the moment, carpe diem. While intellectually, the existentialist giants, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone De Beauvoir, Albert Camus provided much solace to the post-war hopelessness, Jazz was what expediated actions and sprung people back on their feet. 

Besides music's ability to call for action and transcend the conceptual, it also has therapeutic effects on humans. In clinical settings, music therapy has been implemented for the improvement of mental health or neurogenerative disorders, motor imbalances and etc. While each therapy may be tailored to different individuals or groups, I once attended a group music therapy session. The group was first divided into a few sections, each responsible of making a specific sound with our bodies. After each section is able to perform their sounds in synchrony, the therapist orchestrated us to perform to his direction, making our sounds into melodies. Suddenly, the tapping on my laps was part of something great and mesmerizing. I was mindful of the moment whilst also intoxicated by the moment. While the performance went on for five minutes, the feeling of synchrony and togetherness felt beyond the concept of time. 

No language can connect people more than music, a gift that keeps on giving. The Beatles was a global phenomenon 20 years ago, as are the Korean pop stars for this generation. It's healing effects can be physiological, but also spiritual, excavating a truth beyond our verbal understanding. When the music plays, we are glued to the moment and we live.
