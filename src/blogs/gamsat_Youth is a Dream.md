I can't tell if it was a dream or reality. My youth was not that long ago, yet it happened in a blink of an eye and all I remember were feelings. They were fiery bursts or low simmers of euphoria, infatuation, frustration, anxiety, insecurity, loneliness, tantalization,  idealizations, self-soothing. I don't blame me though, as we all go through this shared experience of madness in our youths. In fact, if one imagine a person commanded of a rigid routine, with little say of her/his surrounding people, topics to learn, freedom to deviate, we would call that either a prison or madness. And all those years have left us with vanity. 

I remember love and infatuation to be different than what I feel now. It was a constant fire. It was a kindle of curiosity and attention, a furnace of wondrous romantic fantasies, it was an infernal of shock, disappointment and sadness, a torch of desperate grasp to an end. Yet, I didn't even know the boy. All the love happened in my head, my emotions in my head, but that was enough to sustain my love. 

I remember not understanding my anxiety and frustrations. Though looking back I knew why. We were all supposed to be everything, or so what the easily influenced youth perceived. The perfect figure, style, grades, friendships, extra curriculum were our pursuits when we didn't even know what they meant. I thought I was crazy not able to have them all but even crazier for defying them, for not caring about fundamentally popularity. There was nothing I could do to my environment nor was I willing to change myself, therefore I existed, misunderstood, frustrated and anxious of it all. 

I remember being insecure with so many traits that now I realize make me wonderful. I was always told I was an overly sensitive girl. I was an overthinker and overfeeler. Yet in knowing the abnormality of that, I was even more insecure and shy of my sensitivity. Little did I know, my sensitivity allows me to identify emotions quickly and be a good friend, to explore nuances of other's stories and explore new territories of conversations, to thank, to apologize, to confront, to appease when events warrant them. Though how would the youth of me have known this without having lived an independent life. 

How I wish when I fall asleep tonight, I can wake up to find my younger self and hug her. All the feelings are ok, and will pass, I will say. Whether it was a dream or a nightmare, you will wake up to a reality, perhaps sombre, perhaps stimulating, but you will be pleased with the authenticity of life.
