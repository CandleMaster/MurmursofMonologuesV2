You're quite fluffy and cute,
and I'm collected and cruel.
My first cruelty of all
was when you were first born.
Twelve pups makes a litter,
I assured there were no more.

Squishy and pink, 
like arms on jelly beans.
Slits of two eyes, 
before seeing a life.
Somehow you must dies, 
not ever knowing why.

Adolescence is when things changes.
White coats appear with syringes,
observe and note your cringes,
stomach sucked, limbs stretched across cages.

I'm not supposed to feel you pain.
I investigate, the mysteries that remain.
Though I refrain to say,
Science's biggest betray
is the lives it celebrates
yet demands some wither away.
