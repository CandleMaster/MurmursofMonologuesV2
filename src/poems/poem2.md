title: If You Know, You Know
---
Sterile floors and sterile coats,
no more denatured ethanol. 
Should I scour bench tops around,
or look for another hope?

Sweat beads roll down my cheeks. 
Machines hymn and beep, quietly, asynchronously 
-- answer me.
Solutions empty on weekends, 
it has to be.

Suddenly, a marvelous shadow appears, 
footstep nears 
-- a dear friend indeed,
hears my need.
"We've all been there,"
he says, and returned here,
with ethanol,
RNA free.

A fellow's care received, perspiration eased,
Though too early to respire, is my kit expired?
Though why uneased, when last week I was appeased?
Through another sterile door, four more hours
til my thumb sore.
